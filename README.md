# sugarchain-GUI-miner
This is still beta, however I have added functionality to Windows, but have not compiled for Linux yet. Will do later. GUI will work for both Windows and Linux though.

## Running application
**Linux:** Download, cd to directory and run `./SugarchainPoolMiner(Windows).py` or `./SugarchainSoloMiner(Windows).py`

**Windows:** Donwload, cd directory and run `python3 SugarchainPoolMiner(Windows).py` or `python 3 SugarchainSoloMiner(Windows).py`
