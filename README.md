# sugarchain-GUI-miner
This is still beta, however I have added functionality to Windows, but have not compiled for Linux yet. Will do later. GUI will work for both Windows and Linux though.

## Running application
**Linux:** Download, cd to directory and run `./SugarchainPoolMiner(Windows).py` or `./SugarchainSoloMiner(Windows).py`

**Windows:** Donwload, Extract and choose either Pool or Solo miner. Then run the .bat file. Make sure AV is disabled so that cpuminer is allowed.:+1:
